        overtones.fm is AJ Ferrick. This site has been up-and-down for the last few years, but I'm trying to revive it more permanently. I lost my previous content to a corrupted hard drive...so here we are.

        I <a href="https://twitter.com/ajferrick">tweet</a>, <a href="http://last.fm/user/ajferrick">track my listening habits</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ajferrick">write code</a> sometimes, and track my <a href="https://keybase.io/ajf">identity with Keybase</a>. You can reach me over email at <a href="mailto:ajferrick@gmail.com">ajferrick@gmail.com</a>. Encrypted communication is also welcome, and you can find my public key <a href="https://keybase.io/ajf/key.asc">here</a>.

        I currently work at a news company called <a href="https://cir.ca">Circa</a>. I work on our backend systems: APIs, data, internal tooling, and probably more. Everything that doesn't show up on a phone.

        I graduated from Case Western's Control Systems engineering program in 2011 and Stanford's Management Science masters program in 2014. My experience with the MS&amp;E department seems out-of-place â€” overall it was a positive experience, but my feelings are conflicted enough not to cover here. Maybe over beer.

        I still volunteer at <a href="http://kzsu.stanford.edu">KZSU Stanford 90.1 FM</a>. I do a bunch of things there: DJing, live audio production, trying to keep the computers running. It's a good place and has been important to me.

        This website runs on a simple stack: Jekyll, git, nginx, and Amazon AWS.
