Subbing for an hour-long show, this set consisted mostly of fresh and newly-reviewed albums. Of these, I highly recommend checking out [Ought](http://ought.bandcamp.com/). Pitchfork even has a [decent review](http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19248-ought-more-than-any-other-day/) of the new album. [Be Forest](http://www.wwnbb.net/artists/beforest/) is also worth checking outâ€”but you must listen to the entire album.
