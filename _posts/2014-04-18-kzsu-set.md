I've wanted to publish my playlists from my radio shows for a while now. This playlist is from my last show in the winter 2014 quarter. Called _Setting Fire to the Lab_, I experiemented with a new format that emphasizes newer releases and expands the genres I traditionally play. Instead of confining myself to a post-rock genre, I opened up to include more lo-fi DIY rock, post-hardcore, and ambient music.
