BoingBoing posted a [pretty excellent survey](http://boingboing.net/2014/08/22/art-in-the-infographic-age.html) of some screenprinted infographics by Tom Whalen and Kevin Tong. The [Nikola Telsa](http://media.boingboing.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/TongTesla.jpg) poster is a favorite of mine. Hell of a lot better than tag clouds, at any rate.
