title: This Is Just the Beginning
---

My first, and admittedly late, introduction to demoscene was at Notacon in Cleveland while I was an undergrad. Mesmerizing video paired with original chiptunes, watchable for hours during the con. The demo below has popped up again in a [blog post](http://blog.attractmo.de/post/111642896790/this-is-just-the-beginning-of-what-we-can-do-on) blog post describing how __elix__, the composing duo, are planning on releasing a tracker for the SNES. Cool.
