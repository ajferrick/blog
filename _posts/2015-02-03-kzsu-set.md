title: 02.03.15 KZSU Set
---

This is one of the better sets I've done (at least, in recent memory). Like most sets, it was mostly improvised out of KZSU's new music collection and my own personal collection. The last track was a spur-of-the-moment inclusion: certainly cheesy, but sometimes that OK.
