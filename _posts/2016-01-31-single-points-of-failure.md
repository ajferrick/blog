title: Single Points of Failure

A neat thing happened to me while I was work-traveling.

My only personal computer, which doubled as my work computer, found itself with a bum SSD. Among other things, I lost my music, work and personal code, pictures, and all my private RSA keys.

This is about the third time something like this has happened to me. Each time I say I'm going to do backups. And then I'm lax.

Back up your garbage.

(Thankfully I *had* backups of music and pictures, but they were on a hard drive in California, though I was in Pennsylvania at the time. Hrm.)
