title: Working From the Road
---

I'm moving out of my house in Cupertino and taking a brief working vacation
away from the Bay Area. It's been a long time since I have seen any of my
family or friends back east, so while my current job allows me to work
remotely most of the time, I'm going to be working from the road.

A lot of couch surfing is in my future.

This is the approximate schedule I've got planned so far:

- Oct 10 - Oct 14: CLE (CWRU friends)
- Oct 15 - Oct 21: NYC (relationship + work)
- Oct 22 - Oct 28: ERI (family time)
- Oct 29 - Nov 03: PIT (friends)
- Nov 04 - Nov 11: NYC (relationship + work)
- Nov 12 - Nov 15: ??? (possibly somewhere with a beach)
- Nov 16 - Nov 22: ATX (work + never been to Austin!)
- Nov 23 - Nov 27: ERI (thanksgiving with the family)

After these two months, I have little idea what's going to happen. Towards the
beginning of December I may start looking for a new apartment. Or, I may decide
to keep flying a bit longer, visiting more friends and (maybe!) more far-out places.

I realize I'm very lucky to be in this situation. Some people would take "work remotely"
as a literal directive, traveling the world and keeping up with their job. I'm not
quite ready for that yet; I'm using this as an opportunity to dip my toe into the water
and see how it feels.

For now, I've put all of my belongings into storage, sold or donated my extraneous
belongings, and packed three small bags containing clothes, toiletries, computers, and audio gear
(e.g. headphones). For now, I'm untethered.

(There are a few good reasons for doing this, beyond simply visiting close friends and
family. I'm hoping to write about that soon. I'd like to believe that I'll be doing more
journaling while traveling, but we all know how that kind of wishful thinking goes.)
