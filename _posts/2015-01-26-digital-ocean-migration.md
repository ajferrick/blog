title: 01.26.14 DigitalOcean Migration
--

A few days ago I moved a couple websites ([for example](http://isdickalive.com)) I run onto DigitalOcean from AWS. Amazon had been costing me a decent amount of money and I wanted to try out something new. Setup was a total breeze. I migrated each site onto just one machine and configured nginx to distribute traffic between various doc roots.

I'm feeling good about only paying $5/mo. for hosting, now.
